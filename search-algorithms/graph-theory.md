# Graph Theory

### Main Points
- Made up of nodes (vertices) and edges (links, lines)
- Directed graph is a graph where edges have direction / orientation
- In comp sci - graphs can represent networks of communication, data organization, flow of computation, etc.

Ex.  
```
The url of a website can be represented by a directed graph - where vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent the links from one page to another.
```

#### Adjacency List
-  A collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph
- Each list will describe the set of neighbors of a particular vertex in the graph (think linked lists)

#### Adjacency Matrix
- A square matrix used to represent a finite graph (n * m)
- Elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in that graph
  
- If graph is undirected, adjacency matrix is symmetric
- Directed graph's adjacency matrix can be asymmetric
